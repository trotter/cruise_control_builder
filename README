CruiseControlBuilder
===============

CruiseControlBuilder seeks to make it easy to add your rails project to Cruise Control. It adds three rake tasks to your rails project. spec:ant will run your specs and send the output to log/test-cc.log. build:ant will remigrate your database and then run spec:ant. db:migrate:zero will drop your database to migration zero and is used by build:ant. 

Example
